# PAN-AP14

To develop your software for age and gender identification, we provide you with a training data set that consists of blog posts, Twitter tweets and social media texts written in both English and Spanish as well as hotel reviews written in English. With regard to age, we will consider the following classes: 18-24, 25-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65-xx.

**Early birds**: After PAN 2016

**Test**: After PAN 2016

*Remark. Due to Twitter's privacy policy we cannot provide tweets directly, but only URLs referring to them. You will have to download them yourself. For your convenience, we provide a download software for this. We expect participants to extract gender and age information only from the textual part of a tweet and to discard any other meta information that may be provided by Twitter's API. When we evaluate your software at our site, we do not expect it downloads tweets. We will do this beforehand.*
