#Author Profiling en Social Media: Identificación de Sexo, Edad y Variedad del Lenguaje (In Spanish)

The possibility of knowing people traits on the basis of what they write is a field of growing interest
named author profiling. To infer a user’s gender, age, native language or personality traits, simply by
analysing her texts, opens a wide range of possibilities from the point of view of forensics, security and
marketing.

Furthermore, social media proliferation, which allows for new communication models and human rela-
tions, strengthens this wide range of possibilities to bounds never seen before. Idiosyncrasy inherent to
social media makes them a special environment of communication, where freedom of expression, infor-
mality and spontaneous generation of topics and trends, enhances the knowledge of the daily reality of
people in their use of language. However, the same idiosyncrasy makes difficult, or extremely costly, the
application of linguistic techniques.

In this work we have proposed EmoGraph, a graph-based approach with the aim at modelling the way
that users express their emotions, and the way they include them in their discourse, bearing in mind
not only their frequency of occurrence, but also their position and relationship with other elements in
the discourse. Our starting hypothesis is that users express themselves and their emotions differently
depending on their age and gender, and besides, we think that this is independent on their language
and social media where they write. We have collaborated in the creation of a common framework of
evaluation at the PAN Lab of CLEF, generating resources that allowed us to verify our hypothesis
achieving comparable and competitive results with the best ones obtained by other researchers on the
field.

In addition, we have investigated whether the expression of emotions would help to differentiate among
users of different varieties of the same language, for example, Spanish from Spain, Mexican and Argen-
tinian, or Portuguese from Portugal and Brazil. Our hypothesis is that the variation among languages
is based more on lexical aspects, and we have corroborated it after comparing EmoGraph with rep-
resentations based on word patterns, distributed representations and a representation that uses the
whole vocabulary, but reducing its dimensionality to only 6 features per class, what is suitable for its
application to big data environments such as social media.
